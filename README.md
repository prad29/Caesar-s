# Caesar-s


This Repository contains the code for the popular Casesar's Cipher 

Caesar's Cipher encrypts text using a key and the given set of characters, the given of set of characters reamins same throughout
while the key changes accordingly to the user. Brute Force method can crack Caesar's easily and that's why it is not preffered for
encryption anymore. Still, it's a fun little project.
